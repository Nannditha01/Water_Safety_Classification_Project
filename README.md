# Water_Safety_Classification_Project
Ensuring access to safe drinking water is a critical public health concern worldwide. 
Water contamination from natural or anthropogenic sources poses severe risks to 
health, agriculture, and industry. Traditional methods of water quality testing are often 
time-consuming, expensive, and limited by geographic accessibility. 
This project aims to develop a machine learning-based classification model to predict 
whether a water sample is safe for consumption based on its chemical properties. 
Using a dataset that includes various water quality indicators such as pH, dissolved 
oxygen, electrical conductivity, and concentrations of harmful substances (e.g., 
arsenic, lead, and nitrates), learners will create a robust model to classify water 
samples as safe or unsafe. 
The project will also include building an interactive Streamlit application to allow 
stakeholders (e.g., municipal authorities, NGOs, or environmental agencies) to upload 
new data for real-time predictions and visualize water quality trends across different 
regions.

Project Deliverables: 
● Source Code: Python scripts for data processing, model training, and the 
Streamlit app. 
● Model Files: Trained models and tuning configurations. 
● Data: Cleaned dataset. 
● Documentation: A brief report detailing the approach, model evaluation, and 
deployment instructions. 
● Performance Metrics: Key model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, 
recall, etc.).
